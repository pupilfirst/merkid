<p>
  Hello <%= @student.display_name %>,
</p>

<p>
  Thanks for beginning your application to the
  <a href="https://fullstack.pupilfirst.org">CoronaSafe Engineering Fellowship</a>.
</p>

<p>
  We wanted to remind you to complete your application process &mdash; the seats for the fellowship are limited and
  will fill quickly. We'd like to read your code submission before that.
  <strong>So please hurry!</strong>
</p>

<p>
  A few notes to help you avoid any hiccups:
</p>
<ol>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
    If you are on Windows, you might have difficulty getting the tests to pass because of UTF encoding issues. If you
    get stuck, please
    <a href="https://github.com/nseadlc-2020/package-todo-cli-task/issues/12">refer to the thread here</a>.
  </li>

  <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
    The tests can fail between 12am and 5.30am (early morning IST). This is because the test parses the date from your
    system time in UTC format, while in certain programming languages the date and time functions use the local timezone
    (IST). Accounting for this in the tests will make it more complex and need extra dependencies, so we have kept it
    intentionally simple. So if you run into this specific problem, you can submit your code as is with the transient
    date mismatch, or you can change your code to use UTC. Either options are fine.
  </li>

  <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
    In Windows machines, the `make` command might not exist and can prevent you from running the tests. This can be
    fixed
    <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32127524/how-to-install-and-use-make-in-windows">
      by using WSL, or installing MinGW, among other options</a>.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  We hope you enjoy the programming challenge. We're looking forward to reading your code.
</p>

<h2 class="">3. Submit code for programming task</h2>

  <p class="mb-32">
    To qualify for the fellowship, you have to build a command-line program to manage todos. Once you get all the
    tests to pass, you should then submit the code for review.

      Here's a short video of how the program should work:

        <img style="max-width: 100%"
             src="https://asciinema.org/a/4uiyEA4DHBy1YQcJj4ctY2HWM.svg" alt="Todo CLI app reference video"/>
      </a>
    </p>

    <p>
      You can spend anywhere from 5 hours to 2 days to build this.
    </p>
    <p>
      To make it easy, you'll be provided clear specifications and automated tests.
    </p>
    <p>Note that this is <em>not</em> an algorithms challenge &mdash; think of it as just a fun problem to work
      on.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will grade you on whether your code passes all the tests, and on the clarity of the code you write.
    </p>

    <p>
      We will give you kind, helpful feedback on how you can further improve your code, irrespective of whether you are
      shortlisted for the fellowship or not. But this is limited to just the first 30 students to submit a well-written,
      working application, so hurry!

    <h3 class="mt-32">2. Download a starter zip for your language</h3>
    <p style="color: black">
      <span style="background: gold">You must use one of the following starter zips to build the application.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      This is because they have a detailed
      README describing the problem, and we have also included automated tests that you can run frequently to see
      whether you're building it right.

      listed here, please email us right away. We'll try to set it up as soon as we can!</p>
